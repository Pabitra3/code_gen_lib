## Installation Issues

### Issue: Unable to install the library

**Solution:** 
- Ensure you have the latest version of pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`
- If you're behind a proxy, use: `pip install --proxy http://user:password@proxyserver:port code-gen-lib`

## Configuration Issues

### Issue: Configuration file not found

**Solution:** 
- Make sure the path to your configuration file is correct.
- Use an absolute path instead of a relative path.

### Issue: Invalid YAML in configuration file

**Solution:**
- Use a YAML validator to check your configuration file.
